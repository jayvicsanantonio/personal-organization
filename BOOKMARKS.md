# Personal Bookmark Organization Guide

This document provides a detailed explanation of the bookmark structure used in `bookmarks.html`. Its primary goal is to serve as a clear and consistent guide for categorizing new websites and links effectively, ensuring resources are easy to find when needed.

## Guiding Principles

1.  **Specificity First:** Always try to place a new bookmark in the _most specific_ category that accurately describes its primary purpose or content. For example, official React documentation goes in `📄 Documentation -> Frameworks & Libraries -> React`, not just `💻 Technology -> Web Development`.
2.  **Core Purpose:** Consider the _main reason_ you saved the link. Is it for learning a concept? Is it official reference material? Is it a tool? Is it related to job seeking? This helps determine the top-level category.
3.  **Consistency is Key:** Adhering to this structure consistently over time will make the system much more effective and reduce time spent searching.
4.  **Active Management:**
    - **Review Uncategorized:** Regularly process items in the `❓ Uncategorized` folder. Either move them to a proper category or delete them if they are no longer relevant.
    - **Prune Regularly:** Periodically review older bookmarks in all categories. Remove outdated resources, broken links, or items that are no longer valuable.
    - **Refine Structure:** This system can evolve. If a subcategory becomes too large or a new major topic emerges frequently, consider creating new subcategories or even top-level categories. Update this guide accordingly if changes are made.
5.  **"Read Later" Strategy:** For articles, blog posts, or videos you intend to consume later, consider using:
    - A dedicated "Read Later" service (like Pocket, Instapaper, Omnivore).
    - A temporary browser folder named "📥 Inbox" or "To Read".
    - _After consuming the content_, decide if it's valuable as a long-term reference. If yes, categorize it appropriately (often into `📰 Reference Articles` or a specific technology category if it's a key tutorial/explanation). If not, discard the link.

## Category Breakdown

### 🚀 Career & Professional Development

**Overall Purpose:** Encompasses all aspects related to your professional life as a software engineer/developer, including job seeking, interviewing, skill development (beyond pure technical learning), and career strategy.

- **`Job Search & Market`**
  - **What Goes Here:** Job boards (general tech or niche), company career pages you're tracking, links discussing hiring trends, salary comparison websites (Levels.fyi, Glassdoor), articles analyzing the tech job market conditions.
  - **Distinction:** Focuses on the _external_ market and the _act_ of searching. Interview _prep_ goes in the next category.
- **`Interview Preparation`**
  - **Purpose:** Resources specifically used _while preparing_ for technical or behavioral interviews.
  - **`General Strategy & Behavioral`**: Advice on the overall interview process, common behavioral questions, frameworks like STAR, insights into specific company interview loops (FAANG processes), general "how to interview" tips, resources on crafting your resume/narrative for interviews.
  - **`Technical Practice & Platforms`**: Websites for _active practice_ of coding problems (LeetCode, HackerRank), system design scenarios, mock interview platforms (Pramp, Interviewing.io), and dedicated interview preparation course platforms (GreatFrontEnd, DesignGurus).
  - **`Technical Concepts & Resources`**: Reference materials specifically _for interview topics_. This includes Big-O notation cheat sheets, lists of common data structures/algorithms questions, books focused solely on coding interviews (CTCI, EPI), core CS concept refreshers _in the context of interviews_.
  - **`System Design Preparation`**: Resources _specifically_ focused on system design interview questions, patterns (e.g., designing Twitter, TinyURL), relevant case studies, frameworks for answering these questions, platform examples (Grokking the System Design Interview).

Includes soft skills (communication, teamwork, leadership), engineering management guides, articles on mentorship, conference talk resources (unless purely technical), advice on navigating promotions, dealing with workplace dynamics, public speaking tips for tech, writing effectively in a professional context.
  - **Distinction:** Focused on skills and strategy _beyond_ immediate interview prep. Technical skill _learning_ goes under `Learning Resources` or `Technology`.
- **`Core Workflow Links`**
  - **What Goes Here:** Quick access links to platforms essential for your _daily professional workflow_ or job search/skill sharpening routine. Examples: Personal GitHub profile, LinkedIn, preferred search engine, primary learning platform dashboards (Frontend Masters, EpicReact), personal portfolio site. Keep this list short and focused on frequent use.

**Overall Purpose:** An **archive** for articles, blog posts, and talks that you have _already consumed_ (from your "Read Later" list or found directly) and deemed valuable enough to keep as a reference. This distinguishes them from official documentation or active learning resources.

- **Guidance:** Categorize these saved articles using subfolders mirroring the main structure (`Web Development & Technology`, `Design & UX`, `Career & Industry`, `Personal Growth & Misc`). This allows you to find specific insightful articles you remember reading later on. Avoid letting this become another "Read Later" dumping ground.

### ❓ Uncategorized (Needs Review)

**Overall Purpose:** A temporary holding area for newly saved bookmarks before you have time to categorize them properly, or for links you're unsure about.

- **Action:** Regularly review this folder. Move items to their correct category or delete them if they are no longer needed, broken, or duplicates. Aim to keep this folder empty or nearly empty.
