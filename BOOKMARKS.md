# Personal Bookmark Organization Guide

This document outlines the structure and purpose of the categories used in my Safari Bookmarks. Its goal is to provide clarity and ensure consistency when adding new bookmarks.

## Guiding Principles

1.  **Specificity:** Place a bookmark in the *most specific* category that applies.
2.  **Consistency:** Try to adhere to this structure to make finding things easier later.
3.  **Review:** Periodically review bookmarks, especially in temporary categories like "Read Later" (if you add one) or "Uncategorized," to categorize them properly or remove them if no longer needed.
4.  **Evolution:** This structure isn't set in stone. If a category becomes too large or a new major area emerges, feel free to refactor or add new categories/subcategories. Just update this document accordingly.
5.  **"Read Later":** Consider using a dedicated "Read Later" service (like Pocket, Instapaper) or a temporary browser bookmark folder for articles/links you intend to consume later. Once consumed, categorize them here if they are valuable references.

*   *(Subcategories mirror main topics)*: Use the subcategories (`Web Development & Technology`, `Design & UX`, `Career & Industry`, `Personal Growth & Misc`) to group these archived articles based on their content. This makes it easier to find specific reference articles later.

### ❓ Uncategorized (Needs Review)

**Overall Purpose:** A temporary holding place for bookmarks that haven't been categorized yet, or for links that seem broken or irrelevant upon review. Items here should be periodically reviewed and either moved to a proper category or deleted.
